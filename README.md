# pygameProjects
A repo for pygame projects i have worked on. They are quite basic, but helped me learn a lot. They are in ZIP format, so you will have to download them and extract them.

Once you have downloaded the zip files and extracted them. Open them in an IDE. I would recommend VS COde as that is what i use right now. Pycharm by Jetbrains also works. Add the pygame library to your IDE after downloading python. This is a tutorial for how to do it on windows and VSCODE. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxR0Oz2fkVw&ab_channel=LexicalScope .Then, run the code. Have fun.
